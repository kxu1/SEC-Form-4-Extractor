				- Buying information:
					- Company name
					- Filer name

			4b) One to decide whether or not to notify the individual running the program of a this filing
				based on a few settings set by the individual:
				
				For example, 
				
				Don't notify if:

				- Market cap below 100M
				- Stock price below 1.00 
				- Average volume below 100,000 shares per day
				- The insider purchase is not a direct purchase of a share

					- Get how much insiders have sold directly per year on average in the past 5 years
					- Pull up a graph of the past 5 years, 2 years, 1 year, 6mos, 3mos trend of the company
